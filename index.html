        <h1>The Adventure Begins</h1>
       
        <p>Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a young boy named Jack.</p>
       
        <blockquote>
            <p>"It's dangerous to go alone," said the old man. "Take this sword and shield with you."</p>
            <p>"Thank you, sir," replied Jack.</p>
        </blockquote>
       
        <h2>The Quest</h2>
       
        <p>Jack set out on a quest to defeat the evil dragon that terrorized the kingdom.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>He crossed treacherous mountains.</li>
            <li>He braved dark forests.</li>
            <li>He sailed across stormy seas.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <p>After facing numerous obstacles, Jack finally reached the dragon's lair.</p>
